# Limit Login With Spring boot Security

You will learn how to implement the limit login attempts function with the following strategy:
A user can login failed 3 times maximum. His account will be locked on the last failed attempt.
The user account is locked during 24 hours. That means after this duration the user account will be unlocked (upon the next login attempt).
Suppose that youâ€™re developing a Java web application based on Spring Boot with authentication already implemented using Spring Security and MySQL database (stores user information). And as common standard, Thymeleaf is used as the template engine, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate in the data access layer, and HTML 5 and Bootstrap for the UI.
